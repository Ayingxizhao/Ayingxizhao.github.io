## Abstract
This paper investigates how birth order and cultural attitudes interact to shape educational attainment in immigrant families using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1999-2021) and the World Values Survey. 

I find that **firstborn males complete 1.46 more years of education than their later-born brothers**, representing 0.64 standard deviations of educational attainment. While **firstborn daughters in families with relatively more progressive gender attitudes gain an additional 0.6 years of education** beyond the male firstborn premium, **this advantage disappears in families with traditional attitudes**. 

These patterns persist after accounting for family fixed effects and potential fertility-based selection, suggesting that **cultural attitudes can override typically beneficial birth order effects**. The results highlight how traditional gender norms moderate the relationship between birth order and educational investment in immigrant families.
